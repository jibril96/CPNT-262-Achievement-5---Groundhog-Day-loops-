# Code Journal

* Everying started off just fine

* was able to code my movie list arrays

* I struggled with `innerHTml` `output`

* tried W3schools.com couldn't resolve it.

* Patrick was able to help me understand it.

* was able to change title by `title.textContent`

* I realized that `innerHTML` and `output` can get weird and annoying.

* I Got to start remembering codes without looking it up.

* I need to find up-to-date and reliable sources 

* and follow along and practice more times.

* It sure gets weird and confusing some times but

* It is exciting when you start understand new codes.

* It is like learning to ride a bike. You may fall 

* off a few times but practice makes perfect.
